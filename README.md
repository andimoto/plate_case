## EXPERIMENTAL!
This FreeCad model is made as a stand case for an echo plus device. 
Actually I hope that it fits approximately. I don't have any Echo device. So I don't have the possibility to check it properly :).
This model was made to provide a case where you can install small dev boards, etc, and place an echo device on it.
Top and bottom can be fixed with stand-off hex brass as in my privious raspberry pi case model.
